## üöÄ Overview

Starting a food business in Singapore can be confusing with all the licences, permits, and registrations required.  
This Streamlit app simplifies the process by providing an interactive guide, helping entrepreneurs understand what they need to legally operate their food business.

The app uses publicly available data from relevant Singapore government websites such as:  
- **SFA** (Singapore Food Agency)  
- **MUIS** (Islamic Religious Council of Singapore)  
- **SPF** (Singapore Police Force)  
- Other official sources  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The app leverages OpenAI for AI-assisted guidance. While it is designed to provide helpful information, it **may occasionally hallucinate** or produce inaccurate outputs. Users should always verify against official sources before taking action.
