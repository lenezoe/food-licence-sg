            "To operate a vending machine business selling raw seafood in Singapore, you will need to obtain specific licenses and approvals. Here’s a breakdown of the relevant requirements:\n",
            "\n",
            "### 1. Food Shop Licence\n",
            "**Why it's required:** The Food Shop Licence is necessary for any food retail outlet, including vending machines, to ensure that the business complies with cleanliness and food safety standards. This is particularly important for raw seafood, which can pose health risks if not handled or stored properly.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Steps to apply:**\n",
            "1. **Obtain In-Principle Approval:** Start by applying for In-Principle Approval via the GoBusiness portal.\n",
            "2. **Prepare Layout Plan:** Complete the application form and submit a layout plan that includes a metric scale, indicating the kitchen equipment and infrastructure, as well as the boundaries of the refreshment area.\n",
            "3. **Commence Renovation & Set-up:** After receiving approval, you can begin setting up your vending machine.\n",
            "4. **Request for Inspection:** Once set up, request an inspection from the relevant authorities to ensure compliance with regulations.\n",
            "5. **Complete Payment:** Pay the licence fee of $195.00.\n",
            "6. **Receive Licence:** Upon passing the inspection, you will receive your Food Shop Licence.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Application URL:** [GoBusiness Licensing Portal](https://www.gobusiness.gov.sg)\n",
            "\n",
            "### 2. Environmental Sanitation Programme (ESP)\n",
            "**Why it's required:** If your vending machine is classified under the Environmental Sanitation Regime (ESR), you will need to submit an Environmental Sanitation Programme (ESP) within one month of obtaining your licence. This programme outlines how you will maintain hygiene and sanitation standards, which is crucial for selling raw seafood.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Steps to prepare ESP:**\n",
            "1. **Develop the ESP:** Create a detailed plan that includes sanitation practices, waste management, and pest control measures.\n",
            "2. **Submit to NEA:** Submit the ESP to the National Environment Agency (NEA) for approval.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Additional Considerations\n",
            "- **Food Safety Management:** Ensure that you have a food safety management system in place, as this is critical for handling raw seafood.\n",
            "- **Regular Inspections:** Be prepared for regular inspections by health authorities to ensure ongoing compliance with food safety regulations.\n",
            "\n",
            "By following these steps and obtaining the necessary licenses, you can operate your vending machine business selling raw seafood in compliance with Singapore's food safety regulations.\n"
