            "**Why it's required:** The Food Shop Licence is necessary for any retail outlet that sells food and/or beverages. Since you are selling raw seafood through a vending machine, this licence ensures that your operation meets cleanliness and food safety standards, which is crucial for preventing food-borne diseases.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Steps to apply:**\n",
            "1. **Obtain In-Principle Approval:** Before you start, you need to get initial approval from the relevant authorities.\n",
            "2. **Commence Renovation & Set-up:** Once you have the approval, you can begin setting up your vending machine and any necessary infrastructure.\n",
            "3. **Request for Inspection:** After setting up, you will need to request an inspection to ensure compliance with health and safety regulations.\n",
            "4. **Complete Payment for Licence:** Pay the licence fee of S$195.00 to finalize your application.\n",

            "**Why it's required:** If your vending machine operation requires it, you may need to implement an Environmental Sanitation Regime (ESR) and submit an ESP. This is particularly important for businesses dealing with raw seafood, as it helps ensure that your vending machine is maintained in a sanitary condition to prevent contamination.\n",
